# cxq41_realsense_odom

Code created by CXQ41@case.edu, the great and smart Frank Qian (Just kidding)...

## Example usage

If somehow you ended up here, you must be very bored or you are a student taking Mobile Robotics and you have no clue how to write the code. 

If you download the code and still can't figure out how to run it, go get some help from your TA or Dr. Newman.

## Do NOT Plagiarize!

Please try your best to write your own code, even after reading what I have done. Any question regarding academic integrity refer to:
